/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// class _MyScreenState extends State<MyScreen> with WatchStateAware {
///   List<MediaMetadata> _items = [];
///
///   @override
///   Set<String>? get watchedRatingKeys =>
///       _items.map((e) => e.ratingKey).toSet();
///
///   @override
///   void onWatchStateChanged(WatchStateEvent event) {
///     // Refresh affected item
///     _refreshItem(event.ratingKey);
///   }
/// }
/// ```

  /// If you implement [watchedItemIds] instead, it will be used as a fallback.
